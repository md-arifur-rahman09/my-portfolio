                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4 text-justify">
                    Hello! I’m <span className="font-semibold text-secondary">Md Arifur Rahman</span>, a self-taught <span className="font-semibold">MERN Stack Developer</span> based in Bangladesh 🇧🇩. Though I graduated in Textile Engineering from BUTEX in 2021, my passion for technology started way back in childhood — I always dreamed of studying computer science and was fascinated by how digital things work.
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4 text-justify">
                    After a brief period in business, I decided to pursue that childhood dream. Over the past 6 months, I’ve immersed myself in modern web technologies like <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Node.js</strong>, and <strong>MongoDB</strong>. From long nights of debugging to successfully deploying full-stack apps, every challenge shaped me into a better developer.
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4 text-justify">
                    I’ve built real-world projects like <span className="font-medium">Flora Nest</span> — a bonsai booking platform, and <span className="font-medium">Athletic Hub</span> — an event management app. I enjoy solving problems, creating clean UI, and building full-stack features from scratch.
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4 text-justify">
                    Outside of code, I’m a big fan of nature. I love planting trees and going fishing  — activities that keep me calm, focused, and patient — just like coding does. I value consistency, curiosity, and creative thinking.
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 text-justify">
                    I’m now looking to join a dynamic team where I can grow, contribute, and make meaningful digital experiences. Let’s build something impactful together!
